# Design Patterns Monorepo

This repository contains a curated collection of **software design patterns**
implemented in **multiple programming languages** and applied to **real-world,
frequently occurring contexts**.

The goal of this monorepo is not only to explain *what* each pattern is,
but also **when, why, and how to use it effectively** in modern applications:
backend, frontend, mobile, and full-stack systems.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide **clear, practical examples** of classic design patterns
- Showcase **idiomatic implementations per language**
- Compare how the same pattern adapts to different ecosystems
- Serve as a **reference and learning resource**
- Encourage clean architecture and maintainable code

---

## 🧠 Patterns Covered

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Observer
- Strategy
- Decorator
- Adapter
- Command
- Composite

Each pattern lives in its own directory and contains:
- A dedicated README explaining the pattern
- Multiple implementations by language
- Realistic usage scenarios

---

## 🛠 Languages & Technologies

Examples are provided only where the pattern makes sense for the language:

- C#
- PHP
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- React (when applicable)

Not every pattern is implemented in every language by design.
