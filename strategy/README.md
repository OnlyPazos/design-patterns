# Strategy Pattern

## Intent

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
and make them interchangeable at runtime.

---

## Problem

Hardcoding behavior makes applications rigid and difficult to extend.

---

## Solution

The Strategy pattern:
- Encapsulates behavior
- Enables runtime behavior changes
- Promotes composition over inheritance

---

## When to Use

- Multiple ways to perform an operation
- Business rules that change frequently
- Avoiding large conditional blocks

---

## Implementations in This Repo

- **C#**: Sorting strategies
- **PHP**: Shipping cost strategies
- **Node.js**: Hashing strategies
- **JavaScript**: Form validation strategies
- **Kotlin**: Payment strategies
