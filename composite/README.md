# Composite Pattern

## Intent

Compose objects into tree structures
to represent part-whole hierarchies.

---

## Problem

Clients should treat individual objects
and compositions uniformly.

---

## Solution

The Composite pattern:
- Uses recursive structures
- Simplifies client code
- Models hierarchical data

---

## When to Use

- Tree structures
- UI hierarchies
- File systems
- Menus

---

## Implementations in This Repo

- **C#**: Directory tree
- **PHP**: Menu system
- **Node.js**: Data processing trees
- **JavaScript**: DOM-like trees
- **Kotlin**: Android view trees
- **React**: Nested component trees
