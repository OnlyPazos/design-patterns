# Adapter Pattern

## Intent

Convert the interface of a class into another interface
that clients expect.

---

## Problem

Existing interfaces are incompatible but must work together.

---

## Solution

The Adapter pattern:
- Wraps incompatible classes
- Translates interfaces
- Allows reuse of existing code

---

## When to Use

- Integrating third-party libraries
- Adapting legacy systems
- Normalizing external APIs

---
